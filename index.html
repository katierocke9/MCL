                <h2>LEARNING PHILOSOPHY AND PRACTICES</h2>
                <h3><br>Ages 4-11<br>Small Group Learning</h3>
                <h3><br>GOAL: For your child to be intrinsically motivated to learn and investigate! Get excited to
                    learn :)
                </h3>
                <h3><br>The learning lessons and practices throughout the learning year will be eclectic. We will be
                    drawing
                    from several
                    different theories and practices since all children learn and develop differently. We will use parts
                    of Reggio Emilia’s
                    and Maria Montessori’s practices. The project approach used by the Reggio philosophy allows children
                    to investigate and
                    dig deeper while simultaneously developing relationships. Children learn through and with art given
                    the opportunity to
                    explore, discover and problem solve. Art will be an important aspect to learn with and
                    through.<br><br>Therefore, children are taught actual life skills they will develop and use for the
                    rest
                    of their lives. The Reggio
                    approach uses many of Piaget's and Vygotsky’s theories as well. Jean Piaget’s cognitive development
                    theory fits into the
                    project approach; in addition, Lev Vygotsky’s zone of proximal development also is part of the
                    project approach, which
                    includes the guidance of an adult.<br><br>Furthermore, Maria Montessori also believes in an
                    environment
                    that is stimulating, age-appropriate, and inviting to
                    children. Her hands-on environment and self-correcting materials also show great respect for the
                    competence of children.
                    We believe that with loving guidance, the right amount of stimulation, and teacher assistance, all
                    children can unfold
                    and develop their full potential.<br><br>Establishing a routine and utilizing the classroom as a 3rd
                    learning couch is essential. Building a community among the
                    children and learning coaches will establish an environment that is open for growth, exploration,
                    and trust.</h3>
