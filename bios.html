            <h6 class="card-text">My passion always has been to educate the whole child in a developmentally appropriate
                and play-based manner in a living
                classroom. Learning is as much in your body as it is in your head. “Hands-on” experiences or
                manipulatives during the
                learning process greatly increase learning efficiency. Touch is a strong anchor in behavior and
                learning. Children’s
                movement cannot be restricted but should always be included in as many ways as possible. Children need
                to be able to
                express and label their emotions to develop a strong emotional vocabulary. The classroom environment
                should be the
                “third teacher” that supports learning and routines with manipulatives and access to self-correcting and
                open-ended
                materials.<br>Furthermore, my goal is to instill the love of learning and exploration in each child to
                develop intrinsic motivation.
                To me, the goal in education begins by meeting each child where they are and supporting the family so
                each child can
                develop and grow to their full potential in a developmentally appropriate manner.</h6>
